## Requirements

* Choose a publicly available dataset with at least 10,000 records and 10 variables.
* Do EDA, data cleaning
* Try several supervised learning methods (and several values for the parameters for each method).
* Do model selection and evaluation properly (train-test or cross validation etc.) Show various diagnostics (e.g. ROC curve for classification etc.)
* Discuss which algorithms work best on your data and possibly why.
* Bonus: Try the algorithms on the raw data without the cleaning. Are the results the same or worse?
